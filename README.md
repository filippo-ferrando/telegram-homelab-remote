# Telegram Controlled Homelab

This project aim to create a simple telegram bot to send custom command at my servers in my homelab

I want to be able to execute ansible playbook from anywhere with only my phone and (this is quite important) visualize the ups status; and in case it is on battery mode gently shutdown the servers
